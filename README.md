# Customer Segmentation - unsupervised learning

In this project, I analyze a dataset containing data on various customers' annual spending amounts (reported in monetary units) of diverse product categories for internal structure. One goal of this project is to best describe the variation in the different types of customers that a wholesale distributor interacts with. Doing so would equip the distributor with insight into how to best structure their delivery service to meet the needs of each customer.

## Project environment (based on Python 2.7)
required Python modules:
1) pandas (18.1 or greater)
2) numpy (1.11 or greater)
3) matplotlib (1.5.1 or greater)
4) iPython (4.2 or greater)
5) scikit-learn (0.18.0 or greater)
6) scipy (0.17.1 or greater)
7) jupyter notebook (1.0 or greater)

The best practice is to use [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) toolset with all pre-installed python modules and machine learning libraries.

## How to view results
Open the customer_segments.html for viewing project implementation and results. 

## How to run
After the Python envirnonment setup is done. In command line type: jupyter notebook
This will launch a new browser window (or a new tab) showing the Notebook Dashboard, a sort of control panel that allows (among other things) to select which notebook to open.
